Sometimes, QuickPerf can display a web URL in the console. It is useful to have a clickable web URL in your IDE to open it with a simple click.

_Example of clickable web URL_

### IntelliJ
Web URL is clickable since IntelliJ 2019.

For the oldest versions, you can use THE [Awesome console](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7677-awesome-console) plugin.
