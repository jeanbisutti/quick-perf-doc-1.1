QuickPerf is a testing library for Java to quickly evaluate and improve some performance-related properties (_heap allocation_, _JDBC roundtrips_, ... )
* Provide annotations => Quick and easy to use
* SQL suggestions (_Hibernate_, _Spring_, _..._) and JVM profiling helping to improve some performance-related properties
* Non-regression tests on some performance-related properties
* Work with JUnit 4, JUnit 5, TestNG, Spring, Hibernate, ...
* Do you have a perf issue? Do you find the root cause? An N+1 select? A high memory allocation with a batch?
  Create a non-regression on the root cause to avoid it later.

Early feedback on some performance-related properties during development or from Continuous Integration
* Early reduce performance risk
* Reduce time to analyze performance issues
* Save time 
* Save money
* Build a more environment-friendly software

Can be used to work on some performance-related properties with a TDD workflow

Complementary to other performance tests, as load testing
