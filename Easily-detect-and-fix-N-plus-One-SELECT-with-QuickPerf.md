# What is an N+1 select?

For the following examples, the test  executes the following script before the execution of the test method body:
```sql
    INSERT INTO TEAM VALUES (1, 'Manchester United');
    INSERT INTO TEAM VALUES (2, 'Atl√©tico de Madrid');

    INSERT INTO PLAYER VALUES (1, 'Paul', 'Pogba', 1);
    INSERT INTO PLAYER VALUES (2, 'Antoine', 'Griezmann', 2);
```

## N+1 select coming from an eager fetch type

Let's suppose that our project contains a Player JPA entity having a many to one association with a Team entity:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```
The fetch type is not specified. In JPA, the default fetching policy of @ManyToOne is EAGER.

And let's suppose that our application is executing the following "FROM Player" Java Persistence query:
```java
     TypedQuery<Player> fromPlayer = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player", Player.class);
     List<Player> players = fromPlayer.getResultList();
```


The following SQL statements are then sent to the database:
```sql
    select
        player0_.id as id1_0_,
        player0_.firstName as firstNam2_0_,
        player0_.lastName as lastName3_0_,
        player0_.team_id as team_id4_0_ 
    from
        Player player0_
```

```sql
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where team0_.id=?
    
    Params:[(1)]
```

```sql
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?"
    
    Params:[(2)]
```

Because of the default EAGER fetch type, the Java code sends a SELECT statement to the database to retrieve each player's team.

## N+1 select with a lazy fetch type...

Now, let's suppose that our project contains a Player JPA entity having a many to one association with a Team entity:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```

The fetch type is set to LAZY.

And let's suppose that our application is executing the following Java code:

```java
    List<Player> players = fromPlayer.getResultList();

    List<PlayerWithTeamName> playersWithTeamName = players
                                                  .stream()
                                                  .map(player -> new PlayerWithTeamName( player.getFirstName()
                                                                                       , player.getLastName()
                                                                                       , player.getTeam().getName()
                                                                                       )
                                                       )
                                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Each time the `getName()` method is called, a SELECT... FROM Team statement is sent to the database:

```sql
    select
        player0_.id as id1_0_,
        player0_.firstName as firstNam2_0_,
        player0_.lastName as lastName3_0_,
        player0_.team_id as team_id4_0_ 
    from
        Player player0_
```

```sql
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?

    Params:[(1)]
```

```sql
    select
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_,
        team0_.name as name2_1_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?

   Params:[(2)]
```

# Why can N+1 selects can lead to a performance problem?
*N+1* select antipattern can lead to many JDBC roundtrips in production, and JDBC roundtrips are harmful to performance, as explained in [this article](https://blog.jooq.org/2017/12/18/the-cost-of-jdbc-server-roundtrips/).

Hereafter, we show that, with the help of QuickPerf, we can quickly detect and fix the N+1 select antipattern from tests.

# Easily detect N+1 selects with QuickPerf

## Add @ExpectSelect on the test method

We can detect N+1 select by adding ***[@ExpectSelect](./@ExpectSelect) annotation on a test method*** to check the number of executed SELECT statements.


```java
    @ExpectSelect(1)
    @Test
    public void should_find_players() {
```

```
[PERF] You may think that <1> select statement was sent to the database
       But in fact <3>...

üí£  You may have even more select statements with production data.
```

## Configure @DisableSameSelectTypesWithDifferentParamValues annotation with a global scope

The outcome of an N+1 select may be to get the same SELECT statements with different values. In the previous examples, the N+1 select outcome was to have additional SELECT statements on Team table. These other SELECT statements are the same apart from the id value of the Team table.


We can systematically detect this pattern by configuring ***@DisableSameSelectTypesWithDifferentParamValues annotation with a [global scope](QuickPerf#annotation-scopes)***: 

```java
package org.quickperf;

import org.quickperf.config.SpecifiableGlobalAnnotations;

import java.lang.annotation.Annotation;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;

import static org.quickperf.sql.annotation.SqlAnnotationBuilder.*;

public class QuickPerfConfiguration implements SpecifiableGlobalAnnotations {

    public Collection<Annotation> specifyAnnotationsAppliedOnEachTest() {

        return Arrays.asList(
                 disableSameSelectTypesWithDifferentParams()
        );

    }

}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è *The class implementing `SpecifiableGlobalAnnotations` has to be in the `org.quickperf` package.*


If a test executes several same select types with different parameter values, then it will fail.

## Code examples

Hibernate code examples are available to play with these two ways of detecting N+1 selects: <br>
:point_right: &nbsp; [Hibernate JUnit 4 code example](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples/blob/master/hibernate-junit4/src/test/java/org/quickperf/sql/HibernateJUnit4Test.java) <br>
:point_right: &nbsp; [Hibernate JUnit 5 code example](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples/blob/master/hibernate-junit5/src/test/java/org/quickperf/sql/HibernateJUnit5Test.java) <br>
:point_right: &nbsp; [Hibernate TestNG code example](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples/blob/master/hibernate-testng/src/test/java/org/quickperf/sql/HibernateTestNGTest.java) <br>

The use of QuickPerf to detect N+1 selects in a Spring Boot, a Quarkus or a Micronaut application is demonstrated in [this repository](https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf-examples).

# Easily fix N+1 selects with QuickPerf

QuickPerf automatically detects that the tested code uses _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_. When a test is failing possibly due to an N+1 select, QuickPerf proposes ways to fix an N+1 select with _Hibernate_ or _Spring Data JPA_:

```
Perhaps you are facing an N+1 select issue
	* With Hibernate, you may fix it by using JOIN FETCH
	                                       or LEFT JOIN FETCH
	                                       or FetchType.LAZY
	                                       or ...
```
```
	* With Spring Data JPA, you may fix it by adding
		@EntityGraph(attributePaths = { "..." }) on repository method.
```

As suggested by QuickPerf, the [first N+1 select example](#n1-select-coming-from-an-eager-fetch-type
) can be fixed can be fixed by specifying a LAZY fetch type:
```java
    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Team.class, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;
```

With the [second N+1 select example](#n1-select-with-a-lazy-fetch-type), players and their team can be loaded with one SELECT statement by adding a JOIN FETCH or a LEFT JOIN FETCH in the JPA query:
```java
    List<Player> players = fromPlayer.getResultList();
    TypedQuery<Player> fromPlayer = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Player p LEFT JOIN FETCH p.team"
                                                            , Player.class);

```

With a LEFT JOIN FETCH, the following SQL query is going to be executed:

```sql
    select
        player0_.id as id1_0_0_,
        team1_.id as id1_1_1_,
        player0_.firstName as firstNam2_0_0_,
        player0_.lastName as lastName3_0_0_,
        player0_.team_id as team_id4_0_0_,
        team1_.name as name2_1_1_ 
    from
        Player player0_ 
    left outer join
        Team team1_ 
            on player0_.team_id=team1_.id
```
